Minimal Extended Representations of (p,alpha)-power cones

## Instances mediated

Generated lists of s-values. alpha vector is computed as $\alpha = s/sum(s)$.


## Instances GCLP

Planar points generated for solving the gravitational covering location problem. Sets of 25, 50, 75, 100 points are generated.
